- Creaing a user account
- Viewing all user accounts

- Updating user accounts
- Deleting user accounts
- Adding friends to user accounts
- Creating posts called "thoughts"

- Viewing a specific thought

- Deleting thoughts
- Creating responses to thoughts with replies called "reactions"
- Deleting reactions

Along with all of that there is additional information stored to each user, thought, and reaction that is safed within the database such as the user's friends, friend count, and thoughts. As well as a the user who posted the thought, number of reactions on a thought, and the time the thought was created at.
